                this is a tricky one so I feel it needs to be explained.
                a standalone button uses
                        visible

                        events

                a button sequence uses all of those and more.
                a button sequence consists of multiple buttons which when all pressed will activate a collection of events.
                a button sequence can insist that the buttons be pressed in a particular order.
                a button sequence has a 'parent' button and a series of 'child' buttons.
                only the parent trigger should have events tied to it.
                the parent and children should all have these properties:
                        sequence_in_order = <true/false>
                        mode = 2
                the parent has these properties:
                        parent_id = -1 (default)
                        siblings_count = <number of child buttons>
                        events = <array of event ids>
                the children have these properties:
                        parent_id = <index of the parent in the buttons array>
                        siblings_count = 0
